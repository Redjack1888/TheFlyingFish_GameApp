# TheFlyingFish_GameApp
In this project, you will create a **2D horizontal-scroller single player game** developed following the **[video tutorial by Coding Caf√®](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxefhmF0pcPk6_jdMtHQ1QICTgqbbUvcI)**.

## Why this Project

This project gives you an opportunity to understand basic skills for building 2D Game apps in Java for Android.

## What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Objects in building Android Apps and how to use them to create game challanges of increasing complexity.

## About the Game

The FlyingFisg game is quite simple. The Player move vertically a flying fish touching the device screen trying to catch some colored balls that move horizontally.
There are 3 type of Balls:

* **Yellow Balls** - +10 to score
* **Green Balls** - +20 to score
* **Red Balls** - -1 Life

The player start with **3 Life** and **Score = 0**. When Life is equal to 0 Game is over.

## Possible Future Implementations

The basic game for this project can be implemented just modifying some code variables and adding some methods().
For example: we can add a **Player Level** according to score value and **increase ball speed** to increase **game difficulty**.
At the same time we could provide the user to **earn Life** playing the game.
We could also **add a Database** to keep track of **Player Top Score**.
